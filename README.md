# Robert Sale

You've stumbled upon my profile ðŸ™Œ I like a lot of stuff, especially programming. I have a few repositories on here worth checking out. Wish you could access codepoints in a Swift String using integers? Check out [StringFix](https://github.com/robertmsale/StringFix). Wish there was a Swiftier API for SIMD? Check out [SIMDExtensions](https://github.com/robertmsale/SIMDExtensions). Truth table generator for your terminal written in rust [truth-rs](https://github.com/robertmsale?tab=repositories). There are many more where that came from. Take a gander!
