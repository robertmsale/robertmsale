## U.S. Navy engineer

I sailed the deep blue for a good 5 years. Lots of adventures happened. Now I'm here doing the thing.

I've always been a hard worker. My entire lineage consists primarily of military servicemen who ended up starting a business of some sort. Lots of Salesman (pun intented). After 10 years I decided I should start chasing the dream of becoming a software engineer. My pops bought an old Windows 95 computer when I was a kid and I ended up breaking it a lot. After a while he just had enough and said "you fix it!" Over time I ended up fixing it and became the guy who just fixed computers. I'm sure lots of people have a similar story, being born in the age of technology, but I really just love computers. It's the one tool you don't have to oil to prevent rusting or have hand/eye coordination to use to it's fullest extent.

## Tinkering

I find a lot of satisfaction in identifying problems and trying to solve them using tech. That's why you're here, that's why I'm here. We're practically the same. You and me, just buds. Imagine that.

## Swift

I like Swift. I love lamp. But in reality, I am fluent in a lot of languages. Most of them human. But if I go to a Mexican restaurant and say `if (me_hungry) { return gib_me_dats(); }` I would get a lot of weird looks. This is why depending on the situation I use the language I need to use in order to accomplish the task I am looking to accomplish.
